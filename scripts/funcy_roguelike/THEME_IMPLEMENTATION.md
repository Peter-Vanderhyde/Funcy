# Theme Implementation - Milestone B Part 1

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of the theme system for the Funcy Roguelike game, implementing milestone b part 1 as specified in the ideas overview.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Theme System
- **Three distinct themes** based on depth progression:
  - **Caves** (Depths 1-4): Purple theme with organic formations
  - **Catacombs** (Depths 5-9): Stone/gray theme with narrow corridors  
  - **Forge** (Depths 10+): Orange/yellow theme with wide chambers

### 2. Theme-Based Colors
- **Wall colors** change based on theme:
  - Caves: Bright purple (`\e[95m`) and dim gray (`\e[90m`)
  - Catacombs: Bright white (`\e[37m`) and dim gray (`\e[90m`)
  - Forge: Bright yellow/orange (`\e[33m`) and dim gray (`\e[90m`)
- **Floor colors** also theme-specific
- **Remembered walls** use unified dim gray for all themes outside viewing radius

### 3. Theme-Based Map Generation
- **Caves**: Organic rooms (5-12 width, 4-10 height), always connected
- **Catacombs**: Narrow rooms (3-8 width, 2-6 height), more structured, always connected
- **Forge**: Wide rooms (6-15 width, 5-12 height), open layout, always connected

### 4. Theme-Specific Content
- **Monsters**:
  - Caves: Slime, Bat, Spider, Cave Rat, Fungus
  - Catacombs: Skeleton, Zombie, Ghost, Wraith, Specter
  - Forge: Golem, Fire Imp, Lava Spawn, Ash Demon, Ember Beast

- **Items**:
  - **Potions**: Cave Dew (Caves), Soul Essence (Catacombs), Molten Elixir (Forge)
  - **Weapons**: Crystal Shard/Fungus Staff (Caves), Bone Dagger/Spectral Blade (Catacombs), Fire Brand/Molten Hammer (Forge)
  - **Armor**: Crystal Mail/Fungus Hide (Caves), Bone Armor/Spectral Robes (Catacombs), Fire Forged/Molten Plate (Forge)
  - **Gold Piles**: Yellow `$` symbols that can be picked up for gold

### 5. New Features
- **Gold Piles**: Random gold piles spawn as `$` symbols throughout dungeons
- **Trader Interaction**: Press `t` to talk to nearby traders
- **Improved Connectivity**: All themes ensure rooms are properly connected

### 6. UI Integration
- **Header** shows current theme: "== Funcy Roguelike :: Stats :: theme =="
- **Level messages** include theme: "You descend to depth X (theme)."
- **Stats screen** shows current theme and description
- **Theme info function** provides descriptive text for each theme

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified
1. **`config.fy`**: Added theme constants, color codes, and gold color
2. **`map.fy`**: Added theme-based map generation functions
3. **`game.fy`**: Integrated theme system throughout the game, added gold piles
4. **`main.fy`**: Added trader interaction, removed testing mode

### Key Functions Added
- `getThemeForDepth(depth)`: Determines theme based on depth
- `generateCavesMap()`, `generateCatacombsMap()`, `generateForgeMap()`: Theme-specific map generation
- `getThemeInfo()`: Returns descriptive text for current theme

### Color System
- Each theme has bright variants for visible walls
- All themes use unified dim gray for remembered walls (outside viewing radius)
- Gold piles use yellow color (`\e[93m`)

## How It Works

1. **Depth Progression**: As player descends, theme automatically changes
2. **Map Generation**: Each theme uses different room generation parameters
3. **Content Spawning**: Monsters and items are themed appropriately
4. **Visual Feedback**: Colors immediately reflect the current theme
5. **Memory System**: Remembered walls maintain consistent dim gray color
6. **Gold System**: Random gold piles spawn throughout dungeons

## Benefits

- **Visual Variety**: Each depth range feels distinct and atmospheric
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Themes create natural progression zones
- **Immersion**: Consistent theming across all game elements
- **Replayability**: Different themes encourage exploration of different depths
- **Economy**: Gold piles provide additional resource gathering

## Controls

- **WASD**: Move
- **f**: Pick up items/gold
- **i**: Inventory
- **r**: Stats
- **v**: Toggle FOV
- **t**: Talk to trader
- **n**: Next level (testing)
- **q**: Quit

## Future Enhancements

- **Theme-specific mechanics** (e.g., slippery floors in caves, lava damage in forge)
- **Theme-specific traps** and hazards
- **Theme-specific music/sound** (if audio is added)
- **Theme transitions** with special effects
- **Theme-specific boss encounters**

The implementation is ready for gameplay testing and further development.
